<center><h1>Challenge 2011 Training Set A</h1></center>

<p>
This is a collection of 1000 twelve-lead ECGs, each 10 seconds long, to be used
as a <em>training set</em> for the <a href=/challenge/2011/>PhysioNet/Computers
in Cardiology Challenge 2011</a>.  The challenge entails determining which of
the similar records in the <em>test sets</em> are acceptable for
interpretation, and which are not.

<p>
<b>Reference classifications:</b> The final reference set of classifications
for this training set is now available; records listed
in <a href="RECORDS-acceptable">RECORDS-acceptable</a> are considered on the
basis of currently available information to be acceptable for interpretation,
and those listed in <a href="RECORDS-unacceptable">RECORDS-unacceptable</a> are
not.

<p>
<b>File formats:</b> The records are provided in both CSV format (<tt>.txt</tt>
files) and standard PhysioBank format (<tt>.hea</tt> and <tt>.dat</tt> files).
The <tt>.hea</tt> files are short text files that specify the format of the
binary <tt>.dat</tt> signal files.  The formats are those used elsewhere on
PhysioNet; see the <a href="/faq.shtml#signals">FAQ</a> for details.  Note that
the last line of each <tt>.hea</tt> file indicates the age and gender of the
subject if known (unknown ages are recorded as 0, and ages over 89 are recorded
as 90).  No other information is available about the subjects of these
recordings.

<p>
Download individual files from the list below, or download the entire
dataset as a tarball (<a href="../set-a.tar.gz">set-a.tar.gz</a>,
about 103 MB).  See the <a href="/faq.shtml#tar-gz">FAQ</a> if you are
not familiar with unpacking tarballs.
